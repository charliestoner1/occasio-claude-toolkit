> Claude reads this every session — the more specific you are, the better the output.

## Overview

[Company name] landing page. [One sentence about what the company does and who it's for.]

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4
- Animation: Motion (Framer Motion)
- Fonts: [e.g., Inter + Playfair Display via next/font/google]
- Deployment: Vercel
- Package manager: npm

## Design Direction

### Brand Identity
- **Primary color**: [e.g., #2563EB (blue) — used for CTAs and key actions]
- **Accent color**: [e.g., #F59E0B (amber) — used sparingly for highlights]
- **Background**: [e.g., white / dark (#0A0A0A) / gradient]
- **Typography**: [e.g., clean and modern / editorial and bold / playful]
- **Overall mood**: [e.g., trustworthy and professional / bold and disruptive / warm and approachable]

### Reference Sites
[Paste 2-3 URLs of sites whose design you admire and say what you like about each]
- [site1.com] — [what you like: layout, typography, animations, etc.]
- [site2.com] — [what you like]

### Brand Assets
- Logo: [path, e.g., /public/logo.svg]
- Favicon: [path]
- Hero image/video: [path or "generate with /motion-graphics" or "use fal MCP"]

## Page Structure

[Define the sections you want. Remove or add as needed.]

1. **Nav** — logo left, links center, CTA button right. Sticky on scroll.
2. **Hero** — [headline + subheadline + CTA + visual. Full viewport height.]
3. **Social proof** — [logo bar of clients/partners, or testimonial quotes]
4. **Features/Benefits** — [3-4 key selling points with icons or visuals]
5. **How it works** — [3-step process or workflow diagram]
6. **Testimonials** — [customer quotes with photos and titles]
7. **Pricing** — [if applicable — tiers or single plan]
8. **CTA section** — [final conversion push — headline + form or button]
9. **Footer** — [links, social icons, legal]

## Content

### Headline Options
[Give Claude 2-3 headline directions to choose from or riff on]
- Option A: "[e.g., Ship faster with AI-powered workflows]"
- Option B: "[e.g., The platform that turns ideas into products]"

### Key Messages
- [Core value prop in one sentence]
- [Secondary differentiator]
- [Social proof point: "Trusted by 500+ teams" etc.]

## Conventions

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Components in `components/`, pages in `app/`
- One component per file, named exports
- Use `cn()` from `lib/utils` for conditional classes (clsx + twMerge)

### Component Patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design (default = mobile, `md:` = desktop)
- 44px minimum touch targets on interactive elements
- Use CSS variables for colors — enables easy theme switching later
- Prefer `gap` over margin for spacing between siblings
- Images: use `next/image` with proper width/height/alt

### Animation Rules
- Subtle entrance animations (fade + 12px translate, 300ms)
- No animation-on-scroll unless specifically requested
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Use Motion (Framer Motion) for interactive animations
- CSS transitions for hover/focus states

### Performance
- All images optimized (WebP, proper sizing, lazy load below fold)
- Fonts loaded via `next/font` (no layout shift)
- No client components unless they need interactivity
- Aim for 95+ Lighthouse score

## Available Skills — Use These Proactively

Read `PROMPTS.md` for detailed examples. Suggest these to the user when relevant.

### Design & Build
- `/landing-page full` — build the entire page section by section (or `/landing-page hero` for one section)
- `/frontend-design` — **auto-activates** on any UI task. No need to invoke manually.
- `/ui-ux-pro-max` — suggest when the user needs design direction (styles, palettes, fonts)

### Animation & Visual
- `/animate <description>` — Framer Motion, CSS keyframes. Suggest after building a section to add polish.
- `/3d-scene <description>` — Three.js / R3F. Suggest for hero elements, product showcases.
- `/motion-graphics <description>` — Lottie, SVG animation, Canvas. Suggest for logos, counters, particles.

### Quality (suggest before deploying)
- `/perf-audit` — Lighthouse, bundle size, images, Core Web Vitals
- `/a11y-audit` — ARIA, keyboard nav, contrast, screen reader
- `/review-changes` — code review against all conventions
- `/ship-it` — runs everything in parallel (build + tests + review + audit)

### Workflow
- `/gsd:new-project` — for complex multi-phase builds; creates roadmap + phased execution
- `/gsd:quick <task>` — one-off task with atomic commits

### Integration
- `/openai-figma` — auto-activates on Figma URLs. Pulls designs for code conversion.
- **fal MCP** — use for AI image generation when the user needs hero images, illustrations, backgrounds
- **context7 MCP** — auto-looks up latest library docs. Always use current APIs.

### Skill Chaining Pattern
Build → Animate → Audit:
1. Build the section (auto-activates `/frontend-design`)
2. `/animate` the section for entrance animations or interactions
3. `/perf-audit` + `/a11y-audit` before deploying

## Don'ts
- No generic AI aesthetic (avoid default gradients, excessive glow, generic stock feel)
- No placeholder text in final output — write real copy or ask me for it
- No `text-white` on themed backgrounds — use CSS variables
- No inline styles — Tailwind only
- No lorem ipsum — write contextual placeholder copy if real copy isn't provided
